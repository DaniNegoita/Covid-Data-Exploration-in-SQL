# Covid-Data-Exploration-in-SQL

This project extracts meaningful insights from Covid data by using SQL fundamentals:
1) I executed an inner join between two tables inherent to death and vaccination counts
2) Combined commands with aggregate functions to explore infection rates, vaccination shares etc.
3) Expanded on the analysis by using CTE, temp tables, subqueries, and created a View for visualisation purposes.
